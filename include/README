These headers are for functions included in libkraknet. If you want to
use them, you should link with that library. Using gcc:
	gcc myprogram.c -lkraknet

Note that libkraknet.so (created when doing a build of Kraknet) is
available in the Kraknet /lib/ directory, and should put linked in
/usr/lib/ or some other sane location.
